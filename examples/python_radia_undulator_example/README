Run a parameter scan using parallel-enabled Radia over a range pole widths for a hybrid undulator

Files:
hybrid_undulator.py - Simulation function, preprocessing function, and objective function
rsopt_scan_width.yml - YAML file defining rsopt setup
plot_scan.py - Can be run after the scan to plot the result (NOTE: You may need to change
the file name loaded by plot_scan.py as it is set automatically based on the scan setup)

To run, execute in command line:
rsopt sample configuration rsopt_scan_width.yml

To test with a single point (will just run the start point and not the whole scan):
rsopt sample start rsopt_scan_width.yml


Notes:
- This example can be run in serial as well by changing `execution_type` to serial. In this case you can uncomment
the `preprocess` option (ln 42 in rsop_scan_width.yml). This has the advantage of only needing to run
magnet property calculations once, at the run start, but is not required.
See hybrid_undulator.py and rsopt_scan_width.yml for more comments on this.

- When run in parallel  the return value does not get passed back to rsopt because it is run in a new process.
Hence the `objective_function` is used to load the result from file and pass it to rsopt.
The `objective_function` line can be commented out if you are running in serial.
