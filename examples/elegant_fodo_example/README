Example of a local optimizer evaluating elegant to match final conditions of a FODO lattice.
This example shows how to configure rsopt using a Python script instead of a YAML configuration file.

Has an additional dependence of rsbeams to read SDDS files: https://github.com/radiasoft/rsbeams

To run in terminal: python fodo_opt.YAML

Note: This example is designed to show setup of rsopt on a simple problem.
      This is not an efficient way to solve the optimization problem shown.
