Testing libEnsemble generator for the Multi-Objective Bayesian approach implemented by https://github.com/ChristopherMayes/Xopt

1st example, the TNK function:
To run: rsopt optimize configuration config_mobo.yml
Plotting script: python plot_result.py
(may need to change the name of `history_file` in plot_result.py)

2nd example, the OSY function - implemented from PYMOO. This example uses GPU execution for the MOBO model by default.
To run: rsopt optimize configuration config_mobo_osy.yml
