This example executes the NERSC provided executable "check-mpi.gnu.pm" which will provide a printout of the
Node placement and process affinity assignment. This can be useful to check resource allocation while setting up
larger jobs. This also illustates the ability of "user" jobs in rsopt to run without supplying an input file, in the
case where you just have an executable.

The batch script (rsopt_resource_check.sh) assumes that rsopt has been installed into a conda environment.
If you have done this you should edit INSERT_RSOPT_CONDA_ENV on line 9 with the name of your environment.

To run: "sbatch rsopt_resource_check.sh"
The resulting printouts will be in the worker log files in their directories (ensemble/worker#/sim#/).
