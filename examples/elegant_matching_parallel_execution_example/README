Example of a local optimizer evaluating Pelegant. The local optimizer can only take on evaluation at a time,
but the evaluation is run in parallel using Pelegant.

Has an additional dependence of rsbeams to read SDDS files: https://github.com/radiasoft/rsbeams

To run in terminal: rsopt optimize configuration match_parallel.yml

Note: this example is a demonstration of how to run with rsopt using parallel evaluation setup, with a very simple
example problem. This is not intended to be an efficient way to solve the optimization problem shown.
