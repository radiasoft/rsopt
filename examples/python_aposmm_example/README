This directory has two examples. One for a global optimizer setup and one for a parameter scan.

config_six_hump_camel.yaml:
Example of running a global optimizer through rsopt. Uses the optimization algorithm APOSMM [1] through libEnsemble.
Runs 4 workers on the six-hump camel problem and should find 4 of the 6 global minima.

To run in a terminal: rsopt optimize configuration config_six_hump_camel.yaml


config_scan_six_hump_camel.yaml:
Example of a parameter scan on a uniform mesh. The number of samples is specified with the `samples` field under each
parameter. For N parameters and M samples this will result in a total of N*M points evaluated.

To run in a terminal: rsopt sample configuration config_scan_six_hump_camel.yaml
