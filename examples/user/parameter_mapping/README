This example illustrates how to set up execution of an arbitrary executable through the "user" job.
The fields that generally need to be filled are:
 * run_command: An executable that must be in PATH at run time
 * input_file: If the executable expects an input file argument it should be given here. e.g.
        > ./foo bar.txt
 * file_definitions: Name of a Python file containing string variables for any additional files that should
                     be present at execution. At run time rsopt will try to fill any string format fields with
                     values from the settings and/or parameter blocks.
                     This field is optional.
 * file_mapping: A mapping of the variable names in `file_definitions` to the file names each should be written to.
                 This field is only needed if `file_definitions` is given.

If you need to edit what would be your input_file with values from settings/parameters then `input_file` can be left blank
and instead you can provide the input file through the file_definitions/file_mapping interface. You will then
need to include the input file name through `code_arguments` (see: https://rsopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html#general-setup-fields)

The example show here can be run with:
 > rsopt sample start config.yml
